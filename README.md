This is a static website created to mimic a platform for managing subscription fees to various services. 

This was made as part of an online coursework project to immerse myself into Next.js and Firebase to understand more about full stack development.

This was built via the use of Next.js and FantaCSS whilst connected to a Firebase API as a backend. 
VSCode and React libraries are used as well.
